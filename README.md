# Autonomous 'Lunar' Rover

## Overview
This project involved the design, development, and programming of an autonomous rover capable of mapping a 5x5 meter maze while avoiding obstacles. The rover was designed to simulate functionality for potential lunar exploration missions. 

## Features
- **Autonomous Navigation**: The rover successfully navigates through a maze by avoiding obstacles using sensors such as IR, E-Field, and proximity detectors.
- **Maze Mapping**: Developed Python-based algorithms for real-time mapping of the maze.
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Implemented dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance mechanisms.
- **Collaborative Design**: Worked with hardware and design teams to optimize sensor placement and drivetrain for improved performance.
